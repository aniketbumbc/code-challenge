# Pairing session

Thanks a lot for taking times to join our interview process ‚òÄÔ∏è
We are excited for the opportunity to have you in our team üöÄ

At heycar we value the collaboration a lot.
As part of our technical assessment, you'll take part of a pairing session where you will have a chance to collaborate with one of our engineers.
When the session will start, you will have to work on tasks using the Dogs API (https://www.thedogapi.com/).

Please checkout this project in your local machine and open it in your IDE of choice.

## Tech Stack Choices

The project was initiated with Create React App, with:

- React
- TypeScript
- Jest and React Testing Library
- Redux, with Redux Toolkit
- Redux Thunk
- Material UI with Styled Components

That doesn't mean that you will have to stick with all these dependencies during the pairing
session. If you want to, you can add or modify one that are related to:

- State Management,
- Routing or
- Styling

Using React, TypeScript, and Jest with React Testing Library is reauired though.

## Before the Session Starts

Make sure you have created an account and received a key for the API dogs on your email.

Please make sure to check these steps before the interview starts:

- Make sure you can build and run the project:
  - Clone it and run `yarn` to install dependencies
  - Then run `yarn start` to serve it locally
- Check if there are any errors or warnings on your IDE
- #### ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you have a good connection and that you can share your screen ‚ö†Ô∏è 

If there is any problem like setting up the project please contact our recruitment team - they will bring some help.

##  Thank you

We wish you to have fun during the pairing session and looking forward to talking to you soon üéâ
