# Pairing session

Thanks a lot for taking your time and joining our interview process ‚òÄÔ∏è
We are excited about the opportunity to have you on our team üöÄ

At heycar we value a lot collaboration.
As a part of our technical assessment, we have a pairing session when you will have a chance to collaborate with one of our engineers you will be potentially working with at heycar.
When the session starts you will be asked to do tasks like fetching data from a public API to render a list of items.
Please checkout this project in your local machine and open it in your preferred IDE of choice.

## Tech Stack Choices

The project was initiated with Create React App, with:

- React
- TypeScript
- Jest and React Testing Library
- Redux, with Redux Toolkit
- Redux Thunk
- Material UI with Styled Components

That doesn't mean that you will have to stick with all these dependencies during the pairing
session. If you want to, you can add or modify either one of the ones related to:

- State Management,
- Routing or
- Styling

You should though have to use React, TypeScript, and Jest with React Testing Library.

## Before the Session Starts

Please make sure to check these steps before the interview starts:

- Make sure you can build and run the project:
  - Clone it and run `yarn` to install dependencies
  - Then run `yarn start` to serve it locally
- Check if there are any errors or warnings on your IDE
- Make sure you have a good connection and that you can share your screen

If there is any problem like setting up the project please contact our recruitment team - they will bring some help.

##  Thank you

We wish you to have fun during the pairing session and looking forward to talking to you soon üéâ
